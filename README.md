### Hi there 👋

# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

Here I'll tell you a little bit about who I am.

So, I am an electrical engineer who loves to travel around. I decided to focus on software development because I realized that I'm pretty good at solving problems (either creating applications or debbuging codes).

After working with some programming languages like C, Python, Java and Progress, I decided to change the path a little bit and began to study front-end languages.

💼 Experience in: C, Java, Python, Progress... 

🌱 Currently studying: HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript(ES6), PHP, React ...

🙋‍ About me (outside work hours): I love to travel, to practice sports and talk to friends. Ah, and Netflix, of course.
